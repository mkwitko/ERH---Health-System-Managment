#IONIC-FIREBASE-INITIAL-TEMPLATE#

This repository is a initial template of an ionic blank application with firebase dependencies installed and configured.

Ready to use.

In this template we used a mix of angular/fire and vanilla firebase for authentication, because angular/fire/auth seems to have a incompatibility with Iphone devices.

Our package.json is already updated with the most recents versions of the plugins used at the time this doc was written. In order to check if everything is up-to-date, please use this npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates

To make use of this repository, you need to create your firebase project and config your variables in the src/environmets/configFirebase file.

We already created an auth service with many funcionalities ready to production.

Enjoy (:
